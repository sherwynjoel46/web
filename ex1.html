        <h4>Microsoft</h4>
        <p>June 2020 - July 2020 In spite of all that is known about project management best practices, they are often absent from typical construction projects in India. Our experience is such that weak project management practices continue to be a common place in the construction industry, particularly in developing countries. Poorly managed projects cost all stakeholders a huge amount not just financially but also psychologically and emotionally. It has motivated us to carry out the working and functioning of a project using the modern project management tool available in the market; and then comparing it with the traditional software (Excel) which is being used. We carried on an online survey focusing on all the stakeholders related to the project with a view to obtaining an idea of various project management practices in the construction industry. Notably, 80% of the total construction industries in India still use traditional software Microsoft Excel for planning, scheduling, and controlling their projects and 86% felt the need for adapting to new software. We then approached a Pune-based construction company in which Excel is still the dominant source of managing the projects. We expressed our visions and desire to work on one of their projects using Microsoft Project. We carried on the planning & scheduling of the building using Microsoft Project tool. The results obtained were considerably positive than those using traditional software.</p>
        <h4>ZOHO</h4>
        <p>June 2020 - July 2020 Anisoara Pop Storytelling has represented a powerful knowledge-sharing and learning instrument in society and organizations alike. The current paper will showcase several tools that have proved instrumental in facilitating digital storytelling for English language learning/teaching in higher education. Such tools, besides involving students in writing and speaking activities are conducive to enhanced language competence and are likely to stimulate their creativity, production, digital literacy, soft skills, and interactivity in a real open-space networked classroom. Moreover, digital storytelling can be adapted to different content and proficiency levels and represents a tangible record of student progress and basis for evaluation.</p>
